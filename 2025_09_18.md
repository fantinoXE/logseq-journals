					- describe a consumption bundle by quantities of each good consumed
						- units of good n is described by the vector (X1, X2, ..., Xn)
							- goods' prices are P1, P2, ... Pn
							- (2, 1, 3) = X_
							- (3, 2, 4) = P_
								- P1X1 = 6
								- P2X2 = 2
								- P3X3 = 12
					- m = fixed consumer income
						-
						- When is a consumption bundle (X1, ..., Xn) affordable at prices P1, ..., Pn?
							- When P1X1 + ... + PnXn <= m
						-
						- "Budget set" is the collection of consumption bundles the agent can afford
