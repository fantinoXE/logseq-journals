	- Budget Constraint Theory Foundation
		- Consumer optimization framework establishes with agents choosing the best affordable consumption bundle
		- Consumption bundles defined as vectors (x₁ x₂, ..., xₙ) representing quantities of n goods consumed
		- Affordability condition: total expenditure ∑(pᵢxᵢ) ≤ m where m is disposable income
		- Non-negativity constraints: imposed on all quantities to esure realistic consumption scenarios
		- Two-good simplification adopted for graphical analysis while maintaining theoretical generality through composite goods
	-
	- Mathematical Framework and Graphical Representation
		- Budget line equation derived as  x₂ = m/p₂ - (p₁/p₂)x₁ representing maximum affordable combinations
			-
			- Intercepts identified as m/p₁ (horizontal) and m/p₂ (vertical) showing maximum single-good consumption
			- Slope interpretation as -p₁/p₂ measuring opportunity cost of good 1 in terms of good 2 units forgone
			- Strainght line property resulting from constant per-unit prices across all consumption levles
			- Budget set definition encompassing all affordable bundles including those below the budget line
		- Practical application demonstrated through magazine-coffe example with €10 budget
			-
			- Maximum magazines: 5 units at €2 each exhausting entire budget
			- Maximum coffes: 10 units at €1 each representing alternative budget allocation
			- Trade-off visualization: each additional magazine requires sacrificing 2 coffees due to price ratio
			-
		- Budget Constraint Changes and Welfare Analysis
			- Income increase effects producing parallel outward shifts in budget line
				-
				- Both intercepts increase proportionally maintaining slope while expanding affordable set
				- Welfare improvement guaranteed as original choices avaiable plus new options
				- No substitution effects occur since relative prices unchanged
			- Price reduction impacts creating pivot movements around unchanged intercept
				-
				- Good 1 price decrease: line pivots around Y-intercept becoming flatter with -p₁/p₂ slope reduction
				- Good 2 price decrease: line pivots around X-intercept becoming steeper with slope magnitude increase
				- Welfare enhancement assured through expanded budget set containing all original possibilities
				-
			- Consumer welfare implications demonstarte non-decreasing utility from budget expansions
				-
				- Rational optimiation principle: consumers only change choices when improvements avaiable
				- Revealed preference logic: if original choice remains affordable, welfare cannot decrease
				- Potential for improvement: newly affordable budles may provide higher utility levels
				-
		- Advanced Applications and Policy Analysis
			- Ad valorem sales tax modeling showing equivalence to proportional income reduction
				-
				- Uniform tax rate application to all prices mantaining relative price ratios
				- Parallel inward shift indetical to income decrease of 1/(1-t) proportion
				- No substitution incentives created due to unchanged opportunity costs
				-
			- Non-linear pricing structures creating kinked budget constraints
				- Quantity discount example: €2 for first 20 units, €1 thereafter producing budget line link at x₁ = 20
				- Maximum consumption calculation: 80 units possible with €100 budget under tiered pricing
				- Slope changes: -2 slope for x₁ ≤ 20, -1 slope for x₁ > 20 reflecting price tier transitions
				-
			- Food stamps program analysis as targeted subsidy mechanism
				-
				- Commodity-specific constraints limiting subsidy use to food purchases only
				- Budget set modification through conditional income supplemets for eligible goods
				- Policy effectiveness depending on whether constraints bind consumer choices

	- Budget Constarins
		- Consumer theory
			- optimization principle
				- the consumer will chose the "best" bundle she "can afford"
				- focus on financial constrains
					- consuption bundle -> set of all items the agent of the model might consume
					- describe a consumption bundle by quantities of each good consumed
						- units of good n is described by the vector (X1, X2, ..., Xn)
							- goods' prices are P1, P2, ... Pn
							- (2, 1, 3) = X_
							- (3, 2, 4) = P_
								- P1X1 = 6
								- P2X2 = 2
								- P3X3 = 12
					- m = fixed consumer income
						-
						- When is a consumption bundle (X1, ..., Xn) affordable at prices P1, ..., Pn?
							- When P1X1 + ... + PnXn <= m
						-
						- "Budget set" is the collection of consumption bundles the agent can afford

					- Price of commodity 1 expressed in units of price of commodity 2 or inversed
					- Opportunity cost

	- Legge provvedimento
		- Taranto steel factory case
		- Shall == must
		- Void a contract = No legal validity
		- EU Regultation-2003
			- Article 23 Chapter VI (10% fine)-> Connected to Artice 101 TFEU
				- 1% punishing the wrongdoing without court clearance (still in the middle of the trial)
				- The profit is the benchmark, too much and you might damage shareholders
	-
	- Legal families
		- Common Law Systems
			- majority of business contract signed
			- relies on relatively few statutes
				- Natural Justice Principle -> Statutery Law
		- Civil Law Systems
