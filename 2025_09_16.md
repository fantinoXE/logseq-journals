	- Legal Entity Formation and Liability Structures
		- Three primary business entity types establish different liability frameworks for entrepreneurs and investors
			-
			- Sole proprietorship requires personal guarantee beyond company capital, exposing owner's personal assets (house, car) to creditor claims if business debts exceed the initial €10,000 deposit
			- Partnership structure creates joint and several liability among partners, where each partner can be held responsible for the entire debt burden reardless of thei ownership percentage
			- Corporation/Limited company (LTD/SRL) protects owners through limited liability, restricting creditor claims to company assets only, typically requiring higher initial capital deposits (€20,000-€50,000 or more)
			- Italian notary system requires verified capital deposit before business registration, creating legal separation between personal and business assets for corporation structures
	-
	- Stakeholder Theory and Business Ecosystem Framework
		- 1927 Italian academic theory provides foundational understanding of business relationships and value creation
			-
			- Firm system model positions company as central hub connected to multiple stakeholder groups through contractual relationships
			- Market connections include product markets (suppliers, customers, competitors), labor markets (employees, job seekers), and capital markets (stock exchanges, investors, creditors)
			- Institutional relationships encompass government interactions through taxation, regulatory compliance, and public service utilization
			- Technological change serves as external force requiring continuous adaptation and investment to mantain competitive position
	-
	- Strategic Business Positioning and Competitive Analysis
		- Cost leadership vs differentiation strategies create distinct market positioning approaches with different operational requirements
			-
			- Primark cost leadership focuses on minimizing production expenses to offer lowest possible consumer prices, requiring efficent supply chain management and high-volume operations
			- Gucci differentiation strategy emphasizes premium materials, craftmanship, and brand positioning to justify higher pricing for smaller, affluent customer segments
			- Ferrari vs FIAT comparison illustrates strategic differences whitin the same company portfolio, targeting different customer segments with distinct value propositions and production costs
			- Airline industry examples demonstrate strategic variation with Rayanair's cost leadership (older aircraft, basic service, efficency focus) versus premium carriers such as Emirates (new aircraft, enhanced service, quality differentiation)
			- Strategic choices directly impact accounting measurements, cost structures, and performance evaluation methods
	-
	- Core Business Activity Classification System
		- Operating activities constitute the primary value-creation engine focused on core business mission delivery
			-
			- Apple's phone production involves coordinating multiple activities to create technological products meeting evolving customer needs
			- Customer need evolution shows progression from basic communication (20 years ago) to comprehensive digital lifestyle solutions (current smartphones)
			- Genius-level innovation creates new customer needs before customer recognize those needs themselves, particularly in AI and emerging technology sectors
			- Market segmentation requires understanding different needs across demographics (male/female, elderly/young, various lifestyle preferences)
		-
		- Investment activities support core operations through strategic asset acquisition and capital allocation
			-
			- Non-core property investments may include real estate purchases for rental income generation separate from main business operations
			- Equipment and facility investments provide infrastructure necessary for production and service delivery
		-
		- Financing activities manage capital structure and cash utilization for optimal resource allocation
			-
			- Debt financing involves borrowing from banks with interest obligations to fund business expansion or operations
			- Cash investment opportunities include lending excess funds or purchasing financial instruments for returns
	-
	- Accounting System Architechture and Infromation Flow
		- Double-entry bookkeeping system developed by Luca Pacioli in 15th century profides mathematical foundation for modern accounting
			-
			- Each transaction recorded twice showing economic aspect (resource change) and financial aspect (cash/payment change)
			- System ensures mathematical accuracy through balanced recording of all business transactions
		-
		- Production cycle framework transforms inputs into outputs through coordinated business activities
			-
			- Input factors include labor (salary expenses), materials (purchase costs), property (rental/ownership costs), and equipment (deprecation/interest)
			- Output generation creates product/services sold at market prices to generate revenue streams
			- Value creation occurs when total revenues exceed total input costs, producing positive net income/profit
			- Technical efficency measures input minimization for given output levels, while cost effectiveness optimizes rvenue-to-expense ratios
	-
	- Financial Statement User Analysis and Decision Making
		- Internal users require detailed operational information for management decision-making across organizational functions
			-
			- Finance, marketing, and human resources departments need specific data relevant to their functional responsibilities
			- Real-time information access allows internal managers to monitor performance and adjust strategies continuously
			- Annual financial statements represent summary of internal data already known to the management throughout the year
		-
		- External users depend on annual financial statements for investment and credit decisions affecting resource allocation
			-
			- Investors analyze company performance to determine stock purchase, hold, or sell decisions based on profit generation and wealth creation potential
			- Creditors evaluate loan repayment capacity and financial stability before extending credit terms or adjusting credit limits
			- Employees monitor company financial health to assess job security and compensation improvement potential
			- Government entities use financial data for tax collection and regulatory compliance monitoring

	- Computer shop simulation demonstrates fundamental difference between accounting profit and cash flow management
		-
		- Initial investment: €20,000 cash capital provides starting resources for business operations
		- Inventory purchases: 200 computers at €300 each (€60,000 total) create asset base for sales operations
		- Sales performance: 150 computers sold at €500 each generating €75,000 revenue, but only €60,000 cash received (80% collection rate)
		- Operating expenses: €5,000 rent and €7,000 staff costs support business operations
		- Final calculations: €18,000 accounting vs €8,000 remaining cash demonstrates timing differences between economic performance and cash availability

		-
		- Asset valuation principles ensure conservative financial reporting and investor protection
			-
			- Historical cost basis records assets at acquisition price rather than current market value to avoid speculation
			- Inventory valuation uses purchase cost (€300) rather than selling price (€500) until actual sale occurs
			- Conservative approach protects investors from overvalued balance sheet figures that might misrepresent company resources
			- Market price recognition only occurs upon completed transactions, ensuring reliability of financial information
	-
	- Increase the profit
		- 1) increase sales or push the price higher
		- 2) lower the costs
	-
	- Different peopole, different needs
	- Strategy is a series of action oriented to generate the performance
	-
	- Revenues > Expensess = Profit +
	- Revenues < Expenses = Loss -
		- Net Income
	-
	- Technical efficency = Qty sold / Qty bought
	- Cost-effectiveness = Revenues / Expenses (looking into profit)
	-
	- Cost are recognised only for what i've sold
	- Assets 31/12/n == Equity and Liabilities 31/12/n
	- Resources = Assets
	- Obligation = Liability
- ## Public Law
  background-color:: yellow
	- Contemporary Public Law Methodology
		- Transnational Legal approach adopted moving beyond traditional signle-state focus to examine international law, European Union law, and national systems as interrconnected framework
		-
		- Professional practice reqires awareness of multiple system standards governing specific sectors like stock exchange markets
			- Similar legal standards discovered across jurisdictions: Italian Consob, English equivalent, US Security and Exchange Commission all regulate stocke markets with substantially similar rules
	-
	- What is the law?
		- The law is a system of rules adopted by a community to govern actions and relationships among its members
			- What is a rule? --> Compulsory command
	-
	- Who is able to establish a law?
		- Social Dimension of Law
			- Community and rules
				- Stable communities establish rules to order relevant relationships among members
			- Institution (from Latin <ins>institutio</ins>, meaning "to establish" or "to found" )
				- A community that estabilshes and enforces rules is considered an institution
		-
		- Essential Legal System Components
			- Community of people sharing common interests, values, and purposes
			- System of binding rules governing all relationships between community members
			- Specific enforcement authority holding exclusive coercive power including police, courts, sanctions, and expropriation rights
			- Monopolistic coercive power distinguishes legal systems from rligious ethical, or behavioral norms.
			- States cannot accept competing public authorities operating in same jurisdictional area
		-
		- Foundational Legal Theory Framework
			- Institutional Theory of Law establishes law as a system emerging from any stable social group creating governance rules for internal relationships
			-
			- Pure Theory of Law (Hans Kelsen) focuses exclusively on legal norms independent of social/political process
				- Theory centers on "Grund norm" (basic foundational norm) as cornerstone of each legal system
					- In European democratic systems, democratic representative principle serves as Grund norm conditioning all subsequent legal standards
					- Historical comparison --> Absolute monarchies had principle of royal authority as their fundational norm rather then democratic principles
					- Approach deliberately ignores sociological and political factors to mantain "pure" legal scientific method
			-
			- Exception Theory (Carl Schmidt) presents law as established through "state of exception" - power to breach extisting law and create new systems
				- Theory emphasizes sovereign power's ability to suspend norma and legal order in exceptional circumstances
		-
		- Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
			- Article 45 TFEU analysis demonstrates proper legal norm structure using "shall" modal verb for mandatory perscriptions
				-
				- Freedom of movement for workers secured whitin unuon trough binding member state obligations
				- Abolition of nationality-based discrimination regarding employment, remuneration, working conditions
				- Limited exceptions permitted for public policy, public security, public health grounds
				- Each paragraph establishes specific binding perscription using proper legal English terminology
		-
			- Article 101 TFEU competition law prohibits anti-competitive agreements between undertakings affecting trade between member states
				-
				- "Undertakings" defined as business/firms (differents from US legal English meaning "obligations")
				- Prohibited practices include: directly/indirectly fixing purchase/selling prices, limiting/controlling production/markets/supply sources, applying dissimilar condition
				- Cartel behavior specifically targeted: confidential agreements between supposed competitors creating artificial market concentration
		- Legal document Classification System
			- Legal norms characteristics: General addresses (categories not specific persons) and abstract content (hypothetical circumstances applicable unlimited times)
				-
				- Article 101 addresses all undertakings operating in internal market generally
				- Establishes hypotethical scenarios covering unlimited potetial future cases
				- "Shall be prohibited" creates binding prohibition applicable universally
			-
			- Administrative acts characteristics: Personal addresses (specifically identified individuals) and tangible content (concrete occurred events)
				-
				- Police speeding notice addresses specific driver regarding particular incident
				- References specific statutory law (Road Traffic Act 1988 Section 172) but applies it to concrete situation
				- £1,000 maximum penalty and 28-day response requirement create specific obligations for identified individual
		-
		- Formal Legal Requirements Framework
			- Effectiveness requirement: Legal ability to impose binding perscriptions with enforcement mechanism avaiable
				-
				- Difficult to detect in practice until enforcement action occurs
				- Rules can exist formally but lack practical effectiveness due to non-application
				- A law or rule only matters if there are real procedures and institutions that can enforce it
			-
			- Force charachteristics: Power to amend existing laws or repeal outdated provisions (The Ability to innovate the existing legal order)
			-
				- Amendment: Changing or modifyng previously existing law
				- Repealing: Complete removal of law effective ex nunc (from now forward)
				- Overruling: Court decision invalidating previous decision ex tunc (from the beginning)
				- Crucial distinction: Courts can overrule earlier court decisions, but they cannot overrule statutes. Legislatures, however, cannot overrule court cases, but they can repeal stutes
			-
			- Generality and abstractness properties: Unlimited addressee scope and hypotethical circumstance coverage enabling universal application across indefinite number of cases and situations
