- ## Public Law
  background-color:: yellow
	- Contemporary Public Law Methodology
		- Transnational Legal approach adopted moving beyond traditional signle-state focus to examine international law, European Union law, and national systems as interrconnected framework
		-
		- Professional practice reqires awareness of multiple system standards governing specific sectors like stock exchange markets
			- Similar legal standards discovered across jurisdictions: Italian Consob, English equivalent, US Security and Exchange Commission all regulate stocke markets with substantially similar rules
	-
	- What is the law?
		- The law is a system of rules adopted by a community to govern actions and relationships among its members
			- What is a rule? --> Compulsory command
	-
	- Who is able to establish a law?
		- Social Dimension of Law
			- Community and rules
				- Stable communities establish rules to order relevant relationships among members
			- Institution (from Latin <ins>institutio</ins>, meaning "to establish" or "to found" )
				- A community that estabilshes and enforces rules is considered an institution
		-
		- Essential Legal System Components
			- Community of people sharing common interests, values, and purposes
			- System of binding rules governing all relationships between community members
			- Specific enforcement authority holding exclusive coercive power including police, courts, sanctions, and expropriation rights
			- Monopolistic coercive power distinguishes legal systems from rligious ethical, or behavioral norms.
			- States cannot accept competing public authorities operating in same jurisdictional area
		-
		- Foundational Legal Theory Framework
			- Institutional Theory of Law establishes law as a system emerging from any stable social group creating governance rules for internal relationships
			-
			- Pure Theory of Law (Hans Kelsen) focuses exclusively on legal norms independent of social/political process
				- Theory centers on "Grund norm" (basic foundational norm) as cornerstone of each legal system
					- In European democratic systems, democratic representative principle serves as Grund norm conditioning all subsequent legal standards
					- Historical comparison --> Absolute monarchies had principle of royal authority as their fundational norm rather then democratic principles
					- Approach deliberately ignores sociological and political factors to mantain "pure" legal scientific method
			-
			- Exception Theory (Carl Schmidt) presents law as established through "state of exception" - power to breach extisting law and create new systems
				- Theory emphasizes sovereign power's ability to suspend norma and legal order in exceptional circumstances
		-
		- Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union
			- Article 45 TFEU analysis demonstrates proper legal norm structure using "shall" modal verb for mandatory perscriptions
				-
				- Freedom of movement for workers secured whitin unuon trough binding member state obligations
				- Abolition of nationality-based discrimination regarding employment, remuneration, working conditions
				- Limited exceptions permitted for public policy, public security, public health grounds
				- Each paragraph establishes specific binding perscription using proper legal English terminology
		-
			- Article 101 TFEU competition law prohibits anti-competitive agreements between undertakings affecting trade between member states
				-
				- "Undertakings" defined as business/firms (differents from US legal English meaning "obligations")
				- Prohibited practices include: directly/indirectly fixing purchase/selling prices, limiting/controlling production/markets/supply sources, applying dissimilar condition
				- Cartel behavior specifically targeted: confidential agreements between supposed competitors creating artificial market concentration
		- Legal document Classification System
			- Legal norms characteristics: General addresses (categories not specific persons) and abstract content (hypothetical circumstances applicable unlimited times)
				-
				- Article 101 addresses all undertakings operating in internal market generally
				- Establishes hypotethical scenarios covering unlimited potetial future cases
				- "Shall be prohibited" creates binding prohibition applicable universally
			-
			- Administrative acts characteristics: Personal addresses (specifically identified individuals) and tangible content (concrete occurred events)
				-
				- Police speeding notice addresses specific driver regarding particular incident
				- References specific statutory law (Road Traffic Act 1988 Section 172) but applies it to concrete situation
				- Â£1,000 maximum penalty and 28-day response requirement create specific obligations for identified individual
		-
		- Formal Legal Requirements Framework
			- Effectiveness requirement: Legal ability to impose binding perscriptions with enforcement mechanism avaiable
				-
				- Difficult to detect in practice until enforcement action occurs
				- Rules can exist formally but lack practical effectiveness due to non-application
				- A law or rule only matters if there are real procedures and institutions that can enforce it
			-
			- Force charachteristics: Power to amend existing laws or repeal outdated provisions (The Ability to innovate the existing legal order)
			-
				- Amendment: Changing or modifyng previously existing law
				- Repealing: Complete removal of law effective ex nunc (from now forward)
				- Overruling: Court decision invalidating previous decision ex tunc (from the beginning)
				- Crucial distinction: Courts can overrule earlier court decisions, but they cannot overrule statutes. Legislatures, however, cannot overrule court cases, but they can repeal stutes
			-
			- Generality and abstractness properties: Unlimited addressee scope and hypotethical circumstance coverage enabling universal application across indefinite number of cases and situations
