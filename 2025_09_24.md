	- Consumer Choice Theory Foundations
		- Established comprehensive framework for modeling economic decision-making where rational agents select optimal consumption bundles from avaiable alternatives within budget constraints
			-
			- Framework assumes agents can always identify preferences between any two consumption options
			- Budget constraints represented graphically in two-dimensional commodity space (x₁, x₂)
			- Model focuses on agent behavior analysis given preferences, not preference fromation
			- Applications extend to various economic contexts from streaming platform choices to commodity purchases
			-
	- Preference Relations and Logical Structure
		- Defined three fundamental preference relation types with formal mathematical notation enabling logical analysis
			-
			- Strict preference: Agent definitely chooses X over Y when both available, indicating higher welfare
			- Indifference: Agent equally statisfied with either option, implying identical welfare levels
			- Weak preference: Agent finds x at least as good as y, encompassing both strict preference and indifference cases
			- Mathematical notation uses intuitive symbols: ≻ for strict, ~ for indifference, ≿ for weak preference
			- Relations function as logical operators allowing inference of unstated preferences from known relationships
			-
	- Three Axioms Ensuring Coherent Choice Theory
		- Reflexivity axiom establishes technical foundation requiring any bundle to be at least as preferred as itself
			-
			- Prevents logical contradictions where identical bundles receive different preference rankings
			- Essential for mathematical consistency in choice modeling
			- Rarely questioned in practical applications but crucial for theoretical rigor
			-
		- Completeness axiom ensures agents can always rank any two consumption alternatives
			-
			- Enables consistent choice analysis across all relevant economic decisions
			- Distinguishes economic modeling from situations with incomplete information
			- Allows prediction of agent behavior in any choice scenario within economic context
			- Film ranking example demonstrated how incomplete preferences prevent choice prediction
			-
		- Transitivity axiom prevents preference cycling that would make rational choice impossible
			-
			- If x preferred to y and y preferred to z, logical consistency requires x preferred to z
			- Cinema choice example illustrated how transitivity violations create decision paralysis
			- Action movie preferred to period drama, drama preferred to comedy, comedy preferred to action creates endelss cycling
			- Without transitivity, agents cannot reach stable consumption decisions even with simple three-option scenarios
	-
	- Indifference Curves as Preference Visualization
		- Indifference curves represent all consumption combinationsyielding identical welfare levels for individual agents
			-
			- Curves join together bundles between which agents expresses complete indifference
			- Shape entirely determined by agent's specific preference characteristics
			- Movement along curve maintains constant welfare while changing commodity composition
			- Reference bundle x serves as starting point for identifying all equally-preferred alternatives
			-
		- Downward-sloping property emerges when both commodities represent goods with positive marginal utility
			-
			- Increasing quantity of one good requires decreasing other to maintain indifference
			- More-is-better assumption creates negative slope as trade-offs become necessary
			- Curve steepness reflects relative desirability of commodities for specific agent
			- Higher indifference curves represent strictly preferred bundles due to increased total consumption
		- Indifference curves cannot intersect due to t
