	- Consumer Choice Theory Foundations
		- Established comprehensive framework for modeling economic decision-making where rational agents select optimal consumption bundles from avaiable alternatives within budget constraints
			-
			- Framework assumes agents can always identify preferences between any two consumption options
			- Budget constraints represented graphically in two-dimensional commodity space (x₁, x₂)
			- Model focuses on agent behavior analysis given preferences, not preference fromation
			- Applications extend to various economic contexts from streaming platform choices to commodity purchases
			-
	- Preference Relations and Logical Structure
		- Defined three fundamental preference relation types with formal mathematical notation enabling logical analysis
			-
			- Strict preference: Agent definitely chooses X over Y when both available, indicating higher welfare
			- Indifference: Agent equally statisfied with either option, implying identical welfare levels
			- Weak preference: Agent finds x at least as good as y, encompassing both strict preference and indifference cases
			- Mathematical notation uses intuitive symbols: ≻ for strict, ~ for indifference, ≿ for weak preference
			- Example of logical inference: A ≻ PD ⊁ C ≻ A illustrates how preference relations can be combined and how transitivity (or its violation) affects logical consistency.
			- Relations function as logical operators allowing inference of unstated preferences from known relationships
			-
	- Three Axioms Ensuring Coherent Choice Theory
		- Reflexivity axiom establishes technical foundation requiring any bundle to be at least as preferred as itself
			-
			- Prevents logical contradictions where identical bundles receive different preference rankings
			- Essential for mathematical consistency in choice modeling
			- Rarely questioned in practical applications but crucial for theoretical rigor
			-
		- Completeness axiom ensures agents can always rank any two consumption alternatives
			-
			- Enables consistent choice analysis across all relevant economic decisions
			- Distinguishes economic modeling from situations with incomplete information
			- Allows prediction of agent behavior in any choice scenario within economic context
			- Film ranking example demonstrated how incomplete preferences prevent choice prediction
			-
		- Transitivity axiom prevents preference cycling that would make rational choice impossible
			-
			- If x preferred to y and y preferred to z, logical consistency requires x preferred to z
			- Cinema choice example illustrated how transitivity violations create decision paralysis
			- Action movie preferred to period drama, drama preferred to comedy, comedy preferred to action creates endelss cycling
			- Without transitivity, agents cannot reach stable consumption decisions even with simple three-option scenarios
	-
	- Indifference Curves as Preference Visualization
		- Indifference curves represent all consumption combinationsyielding identical welfare levels for individual agents
			-
			- Curves join together bundles between which agents expresses complete indifference - (lines, drawn in (x₁,x₂) space, that connect consumption bundles between which an individual is indifferent)
			- Shape entirely determined by agent's specific preference characteristics
			- Movement along curve maintains constant welfare while changing commodity composition
			- Reference bundle x serves as starting point for identifying all equally-preferred alternatives

			-
		- Downward-sloping property emerges when both commodities represent goods with positive marginal utility
			-
			- Increasing quantity of one good requires decreasing other to maintain indifference
			- More-is-better assumption creates negative slope as trade-offs become necessary
			- Curve steepness reflects relative desirability of commodities for specific agent
			- Higher indifference curves represent strictly preferred bundles due to increased total consumption
			-
		- Indifference curves cannot intersect due to transitivity requirements preventing logical contradictions
			-
			- Crossing curves would imply bundles simultaneously indifferent and strictly ranked
			- Points x and z on same curve must be indifferent by definition
			- Point y on different curve creates preference ranking contradiction
			- Mathematical impossibility ensures consistent preference representation across all consumption space
	-
	- Perferct Substitutes: Constant Rate Trade-offs
		- Red and blue pencils example demonstrates perfect substituability where only total quantity matters
			-
			- Agent cares exclusively about writing capacity, not pencil color
			- Six total pencils can be composed of any red-blue combination: (6,0), (5,1), (4,2), (3,3), (2,4), (1,5), (0,6)
			- Straight-line indifference curves with slope of minus one reflect one-for-one substitution rate
			- Higher indifference curves represent bundles with greater total pencil quantities
			-
		- Quality difference creates non-utility substitution rates while maintaining perfect substitutability
			-
			- Red pencils write twice as much as blue pencils, establishing 2:1 substitution ratio
			- One red pencil equivalent to two blue pencils in terms of writing capacity
			- Indifference curve slope becomes minus two, reflecting quality differential
			- Bundle (6 blue, 0 red) equivalent to (0 blue, 3 red) due to doubled productivity
			- Demonstates perfect substitution concept extends beyond equal-quality scenarios
	-
	- Perfect Complements: Fixed Proportion Consumption
		- Sugar and tea consumption example illustrates complementary goods in fixed ratios
			- Agent always uses exactly 2 sugar sachets per cup of tea with no substitution possible
			- Bundle (4 sugar, 2 tea) enables consumption of exactly 2 complete tea servings
			- Additional sugar without corresponding tea provides zero utility increase
			- Additional tea without sufficent sugar cannot be consumed due to fixed recipe requirements
			-
		- L-shaped indifference curves emerge from complementary consumption patterns with specific geometric properties
			-
			- Horizontal segments where tea quantity fixed at 2, sugar varies from 4 upward - excess sugar provides no benefit
			- Vertical segments where tea quantity fixed at 4, additional tea cannot be consumed without proportional sugar
			- Corner points at (4,2), (6,3), (8,4) represent efficent consumption ratios
			- Higher L-curves indicate preference for consuming more complete tea servings
	-
	- Statiation Point analysis with Changing Good/Bad Classifications
		- Optimal consumption point (x₁,x₂) represents maximum desired quantities where additional consumption reuduces welfare
			-
			- ice ceeam analoy illustrates how goods become "bads" beyond statiation thresholds
			- Four distinct regions create different indifference curve slope patterns
			- Both commodities classified as goods, bads, or mixed combinations depending on cosumption levels
			- Elliptical indifference curves form around satiation point like topographical contour maps
		-
		- Indifference curve slopes change systematically across regions based on good/bad classifications
			-
			- Both goods region (lower-left): negative slope as usual trade-offs apply
			- Both bads region (upper-right): negative slope as reducing either improves welfare
			- Mixed regions (upper-left, lower-right):positive slope as good must increase while bad decreases
			- Slope direction determined by marginal utility signs rather than absolute commodity charcteristics
			-
		- Well-Behaved Preferences for Tractable Analysis
			- Monotonicity assumption simplifies analysis by eliminating statiation considerations throughout consumption space
				-
				- More of any commodity always weakly preferred to less, ensuring consistent improvement direction
				- Eliminates complex good/bad transitions that complicate optimization problems
				- Standartd assumption in most economic models for analytical convenience
				- Enables straightforward welfare comparisons across consumption bundles
				-
			- Strict convexity crates smooth, continuously curving indifference curves bowing towards origin
				-
				- Diminishing marginal rate of substitution as agent moves along curve
				- Gradient becomes less negative (flatter) when moving down and right along curve
				- Mixtures of bundles preferred to bundles themselves - mathematical definition of convexity
				- Enables unique optimization solutions in consumer choice problems
				-
			- Weak convexity encompasses broader preference class including some linear segments
				-
				- Includes perfect substitutes with staright-line indifference curves
				- permits some flat segments but excludes concave (inward-bowing) regions
				- Mathematical constraint: any chord between curve points lies above/right of curve
				- Provides sufficent conditions for well-defined consumer optimization
		-
		- Marginal Rate of Substitution
			- MRS quantifies willingess to exchange commodities while mantaining constant welfare levels
				-
				- Slope of indifference curve at specific point measuring local trade-off rate
				- Small increase in x₁(Δx₁) requires decrease in x₂(Δx₂) to mantain indifference
				- Ratio Δx₂/Δx₁ approaches derivative as changes become infinitesimally small
				- Represents agent's subjective valuation independent of market prices
				-
			- MRS interpretation as opportunity cost reflects preference-based trade-offs rather than market constraints
				-
				- Amount of good 2 agent willing to sacrifice for marginal unit of good 1
				- Preference-determined measure urelated to actual market prices or budget limitations
				- Local willingness-to-pay concept expressed in quantity units rather than monetary terms
				- Diminishing MRS under strictt convexity reflects changing subjective valuations along preference curves

		- Applied Budget Analysis with Government Programs
			- Basic family budget scenario with €100 weekly income and equal prices for food and other goods at €1 per unit
				-
				- Budget constraint equation: F + G = 100 where F represents food units, G represents other goods
				- Straight line with slope minus one connecting intercepts at (100,0) and (0,100)
				- Standard budget analysis foundation for examining government intervention effects
				- Demonstrates opportunity cost of one food unit equals one other  goods unit
				-
			- Food stamp program analysis with 40 commodity - specific vouchers creating kinked budget constraints
				-
				- First 40 food units purchased with stamps leaving full €100 cash for other goods
				- Food purchases beyond 40 units require cash at regular market prices
				- Budget line segments: horizontal at G=100 for F ≤ 40, then slope minus one for F > 40
				- Kink point at (40,100) represents transition between subsidy and market pricing

				-
			- Black market food stamps analysis with €0.50 resale value demonstarting arbitrage opportunities
				-
				- Optimal strategy requires using stamps first for intended food purchases before selling remainder
				- Food consumption above 40 units: sell excess stamps, opportunity cost of food equals €0.50 in other goods
				- Food consumption above 40 units: use all stamps, pay cash for additional food, opportunity-cost equals €1
				- Two-segment budget line with different slopes reflecting dual pricing structure
				- Demonstrates economic principles of program effectiveness and unintended market responses
