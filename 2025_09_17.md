### Microeconomics
background-color:: pink
	- Economic Theory Foundation & Course Structure
		- Foundational economic thinking approach established using Jonh Maynard Keynes' definition of economics as mental apparatus for drawing correct conclusions rather than memorizing facts
			-
			- Course emphasizes analytical procedures and logical thinking process over specific economic conclusions
			- Mathematical and graphical modeling will be primary analytical tools throughout the course
			- Assessment strategy focuses exclusively on classroom-taught material, excluding untaught textbook sections
	-
	- Economic Model Construction & Variables
		- Economic models serve as stylized mathematical representations of complex economic realities, designed for analytical tractability
			-
			- Models enable causal relationship analysis between economic variables and prediction of agent behavior
			- Institutional setting evaluation becomes possible through model benchmarking for desirability assessment
			- Art of model construction requires strategic decisions about which reality features to include versus simplify
			- Variable classification system: exogenous variables (fixed outside model) versus endogenous variables (determined within the model solve)
	-
	- Two fundamantal economic postulates underpin all course analisys and model construction
		- Rational choice assumption: all economic agents optimize by choosing best avaiable alternatives
		- Market equilibrium principle: prices adjust until quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, creating stable outcomes with no tendency toward change
	-
	- Apartment Market Case Study Setup
		- Hypothetical university city rental market constructed with specific simplifying assumptions for analytical clarity
			-
			- Binary apartment classification: close to university (endogenous pricing) versus distant apartments (exogenous fixed pricing)
			- Competitive market structure with many buyers (students) and many  sellers (individual landlords)
			- Single unit constraint: each student rents maximum one apartment, preventing arbitrage opportunities
			- Rent determinantion onjective: understand price formation for close apartments though supply-demand interaction

	- Economic models
		- Stylised representation of reality
			- Purpose
				- Analyse relationship between economic viariables
				- Understand and predict the behaviour of economic agents
				- Consider wether institutional setting will lead to desirable outcomes
			- Setting it up
				- Wich features of reality do we need to include?
				- Which variables shloud we take as exogenous (fixed outside of the model), and wich endogenuous (fixed within the model)?
			- Two baisc postulates
				- Rational Choice
					- Each economic agent tries to choose the best altrenative avaiable
				- Equilibrium principle
					- Market price adjusts until quantity demanded equals quantity supplied
					- Tendency to not move away from a position
				- Pareto Efficency
