### Microeconomics
background-color:: pink
	- Economic Theory Foundation & Course Structure
		- Foundational economic thinking approach established using Jonh Maynard Keynes' definition of economics as mental apparatus for drawing correct conclusions rather than memorizing facts
			-
			- Course emphasizes analytical procedures and logical thinking process over specific economic conclusions
			- Mathematical and graphical modeling will be primary analytical tools throughout the course
			- Assessment strategy focuses exclusively on classroom-taught material, excluding untaught textbook sections
	-
	- Economic Model Construction & Variables
		- Economic models serve as stylized mathematical representations of complex economic realities, designed for analytical tractability
			-
			- Models enable causal relationship analysis between economic variables and prediction of agent behavior
			- Institutional setting evaluation becomes possible through model benchmarking for desirability assessment
			- Art of model construction requires strategic decisions about which reality features to include versus simplify
			- Variable classification system: exogenous variables (fixed outside model) versus endogenous variables (determined within the model solve)
	-
	- Two fundamantal economic postulates underpin all course analisys and model construction
		- Rational choice assumption: all economic agents optimize by choosing best avaiable alternatives
		- Market equilibrium principle: prices adjust until quantity demanded equals quantity supplied, creating stable outcomes with no tendency toward change
	-
	- Apartment Market Case Study Setup
		- Hypothetical university city rental market constructed with specific simplifying assumptions for analytical clarity
			-
			- Binary apartment classification: close to university (endogenous pricing) versus distant apartments (exogenous fixed pricing)
			- Competitive market structure with many buyers (students) and many sellers (individual landlords)
			- Single unit constraint: each student rents maximum one apartment, preventing arbitrage opportunities
			- Rent determinantion onjective: understand price formation for close apartments though supply-demand interaction
		-
		- Geographical market visualization presents university as central focal point with close apartments in inner ring and distant apartments in outer ring
			-
			- Distant apartment rent fixed exogenously at predetermined market rate unaffected by September student influx
			- Close apartment pricing edogenously determined by September market dynamics and student demand competition
			- Market mechanism definition: exchange system bringing together buyers and sellers, whether physical location or virtual platform

	- Demand Curve Construction Through Reservation Prices
		- Reservation price methodology establishes individual maximum willingness to pay for close apartment access
			-
			- Highest market reservation price €500 represents maximum any student willingness to pay monthly
			- Rational choice validation: €500 payment indicates optimal use of money compared to next-best alternative
			- Step-function demand pattern: every €10 price reduction brings one additional student into the market
			- Sequential market entry: €500 (1 student), €490 (2 students), €480 (3 students), continuing downward

		-
		- Demand curve mathematical properties demonstrate fundamental inverse price-quantity relationship
			-
			- Negative slope characteristic: lower prices attract more buyers, higher prices reduce market participation
			- Step-function to smooth curve transition: with larger market (thousands of students), small price increments create smooth downward-sloping line
			- Economic intuition validation: price reduction makes product accessible to students with lower reservation values
			- Universal demand curve principle: almost all markets exhibit this inverse price-quantity demanded relationship
	-
	- Supply Specification & Market Equilibrium
		- Perfectly inelastic supply assumption creates vertical supply curve representing fixed stock of 10,000 close apartments
			-
			- Time constraint reasining: insufficent time to construct additional close apartments during academic year
			- Landlord profit maximization: any positive rent better than zero income, ensuring all apartments offered at any positive price
			- Supply curve mathematical form: vertical line at quantity 10,000 regardless of price level
			- Simplyfing assumption acknowledgemnt: real-word supply curves  typically positively sloped, but this mantains analytical tractability
	-
	- Market Equilibrium determination occurs at demand-supply curve intersection establishing price PE and quantity 10,000
		- Equilibrium stability mechanism: excess demand at lower prices creates upward price pressure from unstatified students
		- Excess supply correction: higher prices create downward pressure from landlords unable to rent apartments
		- Equilibrium definition: no market participant has incentive to change behavior or push for different price
		- Allocation efficency: apartments go to students with reservation prices ≥ PE, ensuring willingness-to-pay-based distribution

	- Economic models
		- Stylised representation of reality
			- Purpose
				- Analyse relationship between economic viariables
				- Understand and predict the behaviour of economic agents
				- Consider wether institutional setting will lead to desirable outcomes
			- Setting it up
				- Wich features of reality do we need to include?
				- Which variables shloud we take as exogenous (fixed outside of the model), and wich endogenuous (fixed within the model)?
			- Two baisc postulates
				- Rational Choice
					- Each economic agent tries to choose the best altrenative avaiable
				- Equilibrium principle
					- Market price adjusts until quantity demanded equals quantity supplied
					- Tendency to not move away from a position
				- Pareto Efficency
