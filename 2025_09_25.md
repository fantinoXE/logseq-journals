	- Cash basis vs Accural basis
		- Example 1: today a firm buys goods for 1,000 euros, paying ...
			- Accurals: today I record an inventories increase/purchase (1,000) and an increase in Liabilities (1,000)
			- Cash: I record liabilities today (1,000), and after one month, I record the Cash Outflow (1,000)

	- ### 1.  **Cash Basis Accounting**
	- You record transactions **only when cash actually moves** (received or paid).
	- Revenues are recognized when cash is collected, and expenses when cash is paid.
	- Simpler, but it does not show obligations or receivables.
	- ### 2.  **Accrual Basis Accounting**
	- You record transactions **when they are incurred**, regardless of when cash is received or paid.
	- Revenues are recognized when earned, and expenses when incurred.
	- Gives a more realistic picture of financial position.Ã¹
	- ### **Your Example (Firm buys goods for â‚¬1,000 today, to be paid in one month):**
	- #### ðŸ”¹  **Accrual Basis**
	- **Today (when goods are received):**
		- Dr Inventories (Asset) +1,000
		- Cr Accounts Payable (Liability) +1,000
	- (Cash has not moved yet, but we still recognize the obligation and the inventory.)
	- **After one month (when payment is made):**
		- Dr Accounts Payable â€“1,000
		- Cr Cash â€“1,000
		  
		  ---
	- #### ðŸ”¹  **Cash Basis**
	- **Today (when goods are received):**
		- **No entry** (because no cash moved yet).
	- **After one month (when payment is made):**
		- Dr Purchases/Expense/Inventory +1,000
		- Cr Cash â€“1,000
	- âœ… **Key Difference:**
	- Under **accrual basis**, the transaction is recognized immediately (today), because the obligation exists.
	- Under **cash basis**, nothing happens until money actually leaves the firmâ€™s account.
